Select the variable name to quickly provide the creation type, such as ref, computed, methods, function, arrowFunction, watch, reactive, etc. According to whether it is currently vue2 or vue3, generate the corresponding variable and jump to the newly created variable location.

Let me explain the function of this plugin. Normally, when we write code, we first write a template, such as el-input, then write v-model or @click and other events, and then go to the top to define ref or function. With this plugin, you can directly generate corresponding variables or methods in js logic (supports generating multiple variables and methods at the same time), and then you can initialize variable values ‚Äã‚Äãand supplement function logic according to your needs, which will save you a lot of time and the burden of coding to initialize variables.

>If you can‚Äôt use it in Cursor, because Cursor‚Äôs Github Login is not ready yet, here is another way. You can use command: `fast-create-variable.inputGithubToken`, enter your `Github Token`, and then you can use it. This process is absolutely safe. This token only needs the permission of user:account.

Currently, this plugin has a [paid plan](#-charge-plan). If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you can find me on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/ZnjxzMKWNW) and get a one-month free trial.
